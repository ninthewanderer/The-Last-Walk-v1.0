    As our first assignment for this course, we were tasked with making a short game on our own using Bitsy. <br>
    Our only constraint was to use a limited color palette, which was easily achieved by Bitsy's restrictive 3-color palette system. <br>
    Aside from that, we were at complete creative liberty to create a game as long as it had a clear theme or story and at least 2 rooms.

    During this project, I got way too into the pixel art. <br>
    This was great practice for myself as a game developer and artist and it was fun to explore a new game editor! <br>
    As someone who has only worked with Unity, this was a novel and valuable experience. <br><br>
    As for difficulties during this project, as you'll notice when playing, the background music cuts off every time the player interacts with an interactable object. It also doesn't stop playing after the game ends. <br>
    I tried fixing both of these issues by modifying the code and dialog feature respectively, but regardless of my attempts it refused to save my changes.
